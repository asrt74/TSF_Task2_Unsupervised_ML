# TSF_Task2_Unsupervised_ML
## KMeans Clustering (Unsupervised ML)
### The task to predict optimum no. of clusters for given "Iris" dataset and represent it visually
#### Given dataset has 4 variables as SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm,	PetalLengthCm	& PetalWidthCm.
#### Elbow method is used to get optimum no. of clusters
<img>
#### Taking 2 features SepalLengthCm & SepalWidthCm, clustering will be as follows:

#### Now taking other 2 features PetalLengthCm	& PetalWidthCm, clustering will be as follows:

#### To visualize all the features at once, KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) will be used
